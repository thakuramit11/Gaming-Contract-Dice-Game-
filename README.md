# Gaming Contract (Dice Game)

A decentralized dice game smart contract built with Solidity and deployed on Core Testnet 2. Players can bet on dice rolls with provably fair outcomes and transparent gameplay.

## Project Description

This project implements a fully functional dice game on the blockchain where players can:
- Place bets on dice outcomes (1-6)
